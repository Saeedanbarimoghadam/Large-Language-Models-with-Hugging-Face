# Large Language Models with Hugging Face

In this project, I explored several NLP tasks using Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets in Google Colab. The workflow included: Summarization: Loaded the cnn_dailymail dataset and applied a pretrained T5-small model with the pipeline API to generate article summaries, and Compared them with human‑written highlights.


Sentiment Analysis: Used the poem_sentiment dataset. Applied a fine‑tuned BERT model to classify verses into sentiments (positive, negative, no impact, mixed), and evaluated and displayed predictions alongside ground‑truth labels.


Translation: Implemented an English‑to‑French translation pipeline with Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es and T5-small.
