White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will \\\"sadly accept\\\" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \\\"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\\\" Bush told reporters.  Watch the announcement about Snow leaving \\u00bb . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \\\"He'll battle cancer and win,\\\" Bush said, \\\"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\\\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \\\"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\\\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, \\\"and that loan is now gone.\\\" \\\"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\\\" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \\\"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\\\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted \\\"The Tony Snow Show\\\" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \\\"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\\\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \\\"And there are no new growths. The health is good.\\\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \\\"I'm also putting on weight again,\\\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \\\"I actually feel very good about\\\" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \\\"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\\\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \\\"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\\\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \\\"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\\\" he said. \\\"We knew there was kindness out there.\\\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \\\"no stone unturned\\\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \\u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \\\"general donation\\\" area that is marked \\\"Youssif's fund.\\\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \\\"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\\\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \\\"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\\\" She added, \\\"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\\\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \\\"I will do anything for Youssif,\\\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \\\"Our child is everything.\\\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. E-mail to a friend .

White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will \\\"sadly accept\\\" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \\\"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\\\" Bush told reporters.  Watch the announcement about Snow leaving \\u00bb . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \\\"He'll battle cancer and win,\\\" Bush said, \\\"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\\\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \\\"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\\\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, \\\"and that loan is now gone.\\\" \\\"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\\\" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \\\"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\\\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted \\\"The Tony Snow Show\\\" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \\\"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\\\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \\\"And there are no new growths. The health is good.\\\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \\\"I'm also putting on weight again,\\\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \\\"I actually feel very good about\\\" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \\\"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\\\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \\\"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\\\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \\\"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\\\" he said. \\\"We knew there was kindness out there.\\\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \\\"no stone unturned\\\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \\u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \\\"general donation\\\" area that is marked \\\"Youssif's fund.\\\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \\\"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\\\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \\\"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\\\" She added, \\\"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\\\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \\\"I will do anything for Youssif,\\\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \\\"Our child is everything.\\\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. E-mail to a friend .

White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will \\\"sadly accept\\\" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \\\"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\\\" Bush told reporters.  Watch the announcement about Snow leaving \\u00bb . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \\\"He'll battle cancer and win,\\\" Bush said, \\\"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\\\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \\\"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\\\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, \\\"and that loan is now gone.\\\" \\\"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\\\" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \\\"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\\\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted \\\"The Tony Snow Show\\\" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \\\"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\\\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \\\"And there are no new growths. The health is good.\\\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \\\"I'm also putting on weight again,\\\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \\\"I actually feel very good about\\\" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \\\"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\\\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \\\"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\\\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \\\"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\\\" he said. \\\"We knew there was kindness out there.\\\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \\\"no stone unturned\\\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \\u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \\\"general donation\\\" area that is marked \\\"Youssif's fund.\\\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \\\"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\\\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \\\"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\\\" She added, \\\"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\\\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \\\"I will do anything for Youssif,\\\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \\\"Our child is everything.\\\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. E-mail to a friend .

White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will \\\"sadly accept\\\" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \\\"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\\\" Bush told reporters.  Watch the announcement about Snow leaving \\u00bb . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \\\"He'll battle cancer and win,\\\" Bush said, \\\"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\\\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \\\"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\\\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, \\\"and that loan is now gone.\\\" \\\"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\\\" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \\\"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\\\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted \\\"The Tony Snow Show\\\" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \\\"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\\\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \\\"And there are no new growths. The health is good.\\\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \\\"I'm also putting on weight again,\\\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \\\"I actually feel very good about\\\" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \\\"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\\\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \\\"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\\\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \\\"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\\\" he said. \\\"We knew there was kindness out there.\\\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \\\"no stone unturned\\\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \\u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \\\"general donation\\\" area that is marked \\\"Youssif's fund.\\\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \\\"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\\\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \\\"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\\\" She added, \\\"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\\\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \\\"I will do anything for Youssif,\\\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \\\"Our child is everything.\\\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. E-mail to a friend .

White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will \\\"sadly accept\\\" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. \\\"It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,\\\" Bush told reporters.  Watch the announcement about Snow leaving \\u00bb . Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. \\\"He'll battle cancer and win,\\\" Bush said, \\\"and he'll be a solid contributor to society.\\\" Turning to Snow, the president then said: \\\"I love you, and I wish you all the best.\\\" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, \\\"and that loan is now gone.\\\" \\\"This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,\\\" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do \\\"some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties.\\\" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted \\\"The Tony Snow Show\\\" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. \\\"The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,\\\" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. \\\"And there are no new growths. The health is good.\\\" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month. \\\"I'm also putting on weight again,\\\" he said after returning from a 10-day vacation. \\\"I actually feel very good about\\\" the health situation. Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist, and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment.

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. \\\"I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,\\\" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. \\\"I didn't think the reaction would be this big.\\\" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. \\\"We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,\\\" he said. \\\"We knew there was kindness out there.\\\" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving \\\"no stone unturned\\\" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring \\u00bb . Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the \\\"general donation\\\" area that is marked \\\"Youssif's fund.\\\" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. \\\"We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,\\\" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. \\\"We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries.\\\" She added, \\\"He will be getting the absolute best care that's available.\\\" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. \\\"I will do anything for Youssif,\\\" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. \\\"Our child is everything.\\\" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act.
